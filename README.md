# A source xPack with the ÂµOS++ semihosting support

This project provides support for semihosting.

Although initially an ARM solution, it is quite portable and can be used on other architectures too.

The project is hosted on GitHub as
[micro-os-plus/semihosting-xpack](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/semihosting-xpack).

## Maintainer info

This page is addressed to developers who plan to include this package
into their own projects.

For maintainer infos, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](README-MAINTAINER.md) file.

## Install

As a source xPacks, the easiest way to add it to a project is via **xpm**,
but it can also be used as any Git project, for example as a submodule.

### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

For details please follow the instructions in the
[install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### xpm

Note: the package will be available from npmjs.com at a later date.

For now, it can be installed from GitHub:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install github:micro-os-plus/semihosting-xpack
```

When ready, this package will be available as
[`@micro-os-plus/semihosting`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micro-os-plus/semihosting)
from the `npmjs.com` registry:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install @micro-os-plus/semihosting@latest
```

### Git submodule

If, for any reason, **xpm** is not available, the next recommended
solution is to link it as a Git submodule below an `xpacks` folder.

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/micro-os-plus/semihosting-xpack.git \
  xpacks/micro-os-plus-semihosting
```

## Branches

Apart from the unused `master` branch, there are two active branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.

## User info

TBD

### Status

The ... are fully functional.

### C++ API

The following functions are available:

```c++
namespace micro_os_plus
{
  namespace semihosting
  {
    int
    call_host (int reason, void* arg);
  }
}
```

### C API

All C++ functions have C equivalents:

```c
  static int
  micro_os_plus_semihosting_call_host (int reason, void* arg);

```

### Implementation

The architecture should provide a definition of the following function:

```c
  static inline __attribute__ ((always_inline)) int
  micro_os_plus_semihosting_call_host (int reason, void* arg);
```
